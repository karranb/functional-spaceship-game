## How to play

Your spaceships are the top ones. On each round, for each one of your spaceships:
1. Select the spaceship by clicking on it;
2. Click inside the white circle to select the spaceship moving area and
3. Click where you want the spaceship to shoot at.
when you are done click on the `ready` button.

You need to try to avoid to get hit by the other spaceships and to hit them with your spaceship bullets.
